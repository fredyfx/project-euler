Emergent Population Control

Forcing couples to stop having irresponsibly unprotective sex is fascist. Yet it has become obvious that the current rate of population growth is unsustainable. So we have this dilemma: we need to find a way to ease the flow of newborns without resorting to the messy, uncomfortable ad hoc-ery of birth control. So what do we do?

Everyone shall wear a large badge with a picture of the last person they had sex with. The simple force of social self-consciousness will take care of the rest. Here's how:

	>> Brazen, drunken men looking for nothing more than friction will think twice about the quick score -- after all, the only way to erase the record of the event would be to have sex with someone else.
	>> There will be no such thing as undetected adultery; monogamy will be self-enforcing.
	>> Loose women will straighten up to avoid the shame of having their face plastered across more than one guy's chest, especially in small communities. They would imagine (with horror) two or three guys with whom they recently cavorted running into one another.
	>> Ugly people, for obvious reasons, will be mostly selected out of the gene pool.
	>> Blank badges (of the female variety) will be highly prized and hard to taint.

The end result will be a smaller, more attractive population.

Imagining this device makes preeminently clear the momentous importance of secrecy in the sexual realm, a secrecy which I hope we can, with this modest proposal, agree to eliminate. The prudent management of natural resources hangs in the balance.

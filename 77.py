# Bunch of methods: 
# 	(1) coin problem with prime coin values
#	(2) reverse-engineer Euler transforms
#	(3) integer sequence A000607
#	(4) number of values of k for which int_log(k) == n (or sopfr(k) == k)
#	(5) Create an array of primes. We want to find the number of prime partitions of N. Loop through the array subtracting the prime value, then recurse.
